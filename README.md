# Memoreye (WIP)

Welcome to Memoreye, a minimal, clean, and simple multi-OS application built with Tauri. Memoreye is designed to be a dead-simple, straightforward, and blazingly fast photo viewer. 

## 🌟 Why Memoreye?

After struggling to find a photo viewer app that was truly simple, direct, and incredibly fast, I decided to build my own solution. Many photo viewer apps are cluttered with unnecessary features, slow to load, or just plain complicated. Memoreye is different:

- **Minimal and Clean Interface**: No clutter, just your photos.
- **Dead-Simple Usage**: Select a directory and boom, your pictures are displayed in a sleek masonry layout.
